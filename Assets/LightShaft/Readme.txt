Hi if you have any doubt or issue you can contact me at email kelvinparkour@gmail.com.

--For low internet connection we recommend use the LOW quality, unity video player dont support the buffering feature yet, when it supports we will implemment for sure.

This system can be implemmented in other players, soon i'll release as update some packages supporting other players like (UMP, Easy Movie Texture, AvPro).[Right now if you want to implement for yourself you need to enable 'loadYoutubeUrlsOnly' and put call your event in OnYoutubeUrlAreReady, and get the variables videoUrl or audioUrl, other players can play that urls too.]




We are working on a better documentation and poling the system 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QoJULIOb-x278gSfpbevutaXJJAi1RLRHHaUzIk6knw 10/25/2018 less ------  This documentation is outdated, everything now is in the youtubeplayer script, you can take a look at the prefabs, you just need to drag it to the scene, and se the renderer in the unity video player.


For webgl take a look at the folder 'Webgl Youtube Player Setup' if you want to host your webgl player system. (I recommend to use your own, if you dont want to use, just use the webgl demo scene as start).
